## weather-dashboard

AS A someone who spends a lot of time outdoors
I WANT to be able to open a weather dashboard to see temperatures, humidity levels, wind speeds, and UV index for the current day and next 5 days
SO THAT I can plan accordingly

The weather dashboard displays temp, humidity, wind speeds, and uv index for the current day along with weather icons and dates
It also displays the 5 day forecast with temps and humidity as well as weather icons and dates.
